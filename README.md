# password_generation
This code defines an abstract `PasswordGenerator` class and three implementations: `PinGenerator` creates numeric PINs, `RandomPasswordGenerator` generates customizable passwords with letters, digits, and symbols, and `MemorablePasswordGenerator` creates word-based passwords from a vocabulary with optional capitalization and separators.
